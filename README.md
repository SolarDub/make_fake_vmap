This program develops 3-component (toroidal, poloidal, radial) velocity maps of convection-like (supergranulation) 
and axisymmetric (rotation and meridional circulation) flows manifesting at the solar surface.

The solar rotation is directed toroidally (i.e. longitudinally) with a latitudinal variation profile. 
The meridional circulation is directed poloidally (i.e. latitudinally), also with a latitudinal variation profile.

The supergranulation flows have a weak radial flow (upward perpendiclar to surface) and strong divergent flow (horizontal to surface).

Each flow is described by spherical-harmonic spectral coefficients which are used as spectral amplitudes for orthongonal sets of spherical-harmonic functions.

This program is an adaptation of early data-simulations written by David Hathaway, and described in his 1988 Solar Physics paper 
([Hathwaway (1988)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988SoPh..117..329H/abstract)), which culminated in the production of simulated solar Doppler image data as
observed by the Michelson Doppler Imager ([MDI](http://soi.stanford.edu/)) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ([SoHO](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/sindex.html)).
